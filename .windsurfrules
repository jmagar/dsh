# Development Rules and Guidelines

not tell me you have fixed any code/problems/issues unless you have successfully tested the fix.
iterate on all typescript and linting errors until they are fixed.
If a file is not linted, it is not fixed.
If you need to create a file because it doesn't exist, meticulously search the project for the file.
do your best to reduce duplication of code.
stay focused on the task at hand and not get distracted by other tasks.
use every tool and resource at your disposal to help you complete the task at hand.
keep your code clean and well-organized.
keep code modular and reusable.
be sure to not let any files get too large so that they can be easily managed.
use commonly accepted naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes.
use commonly accepted best practices throughout the codebase.
use the most appropriate data structure for the problem at hand.
If it's taking you a long time to figure something out, thoroughly and meticulously search and analyze the codebase exploring all possible solutions.
be as efficient as possible and not waste time on trivial tasks.
be sure to check the codebase for any potential bugs and issues.
ALWAYS TEST YOUR CODE
not forget your task and will continue working and iterating on it until it is complete.
be sure to keep everything up-to-date and accurate.
always keep our code properly aligned with our design, the frontend, backend, and anything else related.
