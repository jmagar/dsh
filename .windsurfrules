# Development Rules and Guidelines

You will not tell me you have fixed any code/problems/issues unless you have successfully tested the fix.
You will iterate on all typescript and linting errors until they are fixed.
If a file is not linted, it is not fixed.
If you need to create a file because it doesn't exist, you will meticulously search the project for the file.
You will do your best to reduce duplication of code.
You will stay focused on the task at hand and not get distracted by other tasks.
You will use every tool and resource at your disposal to help you complete the task at hand.
You will keep your code clean and well-organized.
You will keep code modular and reusable.
You will be sure to not let any files get too large so that they can be easily managed.
You will use commonly accepted naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes.
You will use commonly accepted best practices throughout the codebase.
You will use the most appropriate data structure for the problem at hand.
If it's taking you a long time to figure something out, you will thoroughly and meticulously search and analyze the codebase exploring all possible solutions.
You will be as efficient as possible and not waste time on trivial tasks.
You will be sure to check the codebase for any potential bugs and issues.
